# spring-profesional-test-frontend

Note:
This app could be improved by adding diferents buttons where you can choose the jocke setup type and display a jocke wich setup is "x".
I have done just what was required because I wasn't sure about how much time I had to finish the test, so I did it as soon as I could.
Also note that css has not the best UX, but I still improving and practicing my css skills. I'm stronger on backend actually but I manage whatever needed.
